      description:
        - Modeled a reciprocating compressor in SolidWorks and conducted a FEA across 10 load cases, identifying 2 potential failure modes and reducing unplanned outages by 20%
        - Developed proximity probe calibration curves comparing 4140 vs. 4340 Steel, achieving <1% error, therefore enabling 24/7 vibration monitoring from a single probe model saving up to $15K in cost
        - Analyzed compressor C4007 temperature trends, validating temperature as a reliable indicator of machine health alongside vibration monitoring
