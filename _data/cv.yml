      institution: International Motors
      year: September 2024 - Current
      description:
        - Designed a modular tractor-trailer assembly in Siemens NX (200+ features), cutting model-build time by 15% and supporting 3 configurable variants
        - Proposed novel modularization concepts, including an air horn redesign, streamlining manufacturing and reducing assembly time by 10%
        - Coordinated with multidisciplinary teams to coordinate the logistics for 15+ truck models across regions to support benchmarking efforts, informing up to 30% of the current in-house design improvements

      institution: Phillips 66
      year: May 2023 - August 2023
      description:
        - Modeled a reciprocating compressor in SolidWorks and conducted a FEA across 10 load cases, identifying 2 potential failure modes and reducing unplanned outages by 20%
        - Developed proximity probe calibration curves comparing 4140 vs. 4340 Steel, achieving <1% error, therefore enabling 24/7 vibration monitoring from a single probe model saving up to $15K in cost
        - Analyzed compressor C4007 temperature trends, validating temperature as a reliable indicator of machine health alongside vibration monitoring
