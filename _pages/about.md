Hi, Iâ€™m Rishi â€” a mechanical engineer currently working at Navistar. Iâ€™m passionate about solving real-world problems and building things that are both functional and meaningful. While my background is rooted in mechanical engineering, Iâ€™m continually exploring how I can apply my skills across different domains â€” whether that's product design, biomechanics, or emerging technology. <br>

I enjoy working across disciplines and learning new tools that challenge me to think creatively and grow technically. My approach is hands-on, curiosity-driven, and grounded in continuous improvement. <br>

Outside of work, I like to stay active and inspired. I spend my time hiking, dancing, traveling, and diving into whatever new topic catches my interest. I believe that the best engineers bring a well-rounded perspective to their work, and Iâ€™m always seeking new experiences that broaden how I think and what I can create. <br>
