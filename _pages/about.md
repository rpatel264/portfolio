  Hello, my name is Rishi and I am currently in my first position out of college!
  After 4 years of hard work, perseverance and late nights, I am happy to say that I am working as an engineer at Navistar.<br>
  
  I started college not knowing what I wanted to do with my degree, and although I still haven’t found my passion, I know that I want to keep learning and  
  developing my skills in every facet of engineering.<br>
  
  Outside of engineering, I like to keep myself busy by working out, hiking, dancing, traveling, and learning as much as I can about the world.
  Always striving to learn more and gain new experiences, I hope to bring my passion for engineering and creativity to my career.
