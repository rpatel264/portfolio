## ðŸŽ¨ Welcome to My Creative Side

Engineering may be my profession, but creativity is a huge part of who I am. Whether it's moving to the beat or capturing the beauty of the world through a lens, I find inspiration in artistic expression.

Explore the two paths Iâ€™m most passionate about:

- ðŸ’ƒ [Dance Experience](/creative/dance/)  
  Discover my journey with movement and rhythmâ€”styles I've trained in, performances I've been part of, and what dance means to me.

- ðŸ“· [Photography Galleries](/creative/photography/)  
  A visual space for my photos, organized into thematic collectionsâ€”from landscapes to street moments.

Thanks for visiting this corner of my site where creativity meets motion and perspective. I hope it adds a layer of personality to the technical work I share elsewhere.
