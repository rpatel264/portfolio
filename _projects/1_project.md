<!-- 🧭 Project Overview -->
<h4 class="text-center mt-5">Project Overview</h4>
<p class="text-center my-4">
  Our team collaborated with Atkore to design a more efficient cutting blade. We simulated various profiles, analyzed stress patterns, and machined a physical prototype for validation. We used CAD and simulation tools to evaluate different blade geometries and material combinations. These visuals show the iterative design process and simulation insights.

  Blade designs were modeled in Solidworks, then evaluated in Ansys to compare stress distribution and edge retention across different profiles and materials.

<!-- 🔧 Final Outcome -->
<h4 class="text-center mt-5">Final Outcome</h4>
<p class="text-center my-4">
  We finalized a new blade design using an optimized material profile and showcased the prototype to Atkore. We also built a base and prepared documentation to support further simulation refinement by future teams.
