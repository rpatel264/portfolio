<!-- ðŸ§­ Project Overview -->
<h4 class="text-center mt-5">Project Overview</h4>
<div class="text-center my-4">
Our task was to design and build a 2 speed + idle transmission that could lift hanging weights through a forward and reverse speed at a controlled rate. We also created an idle/brake system that prevented the weight from falling.

<div class="caption">
  We researched different transmission mechanisms to ideate a system that would follow all the requirements, then created a working CAD model.

<!-- ðŸ”§ Final Outcome -->
<h4 class="text-center mt-5">Final Outcome</h4>
<div class="text-center my-4">
  Created a working transmission that can lift up to 2kg at a controlled rate using 3D parts. 
</div>

<!-- ðŸš€ Summary -->
<h4 class="text-center mt-5">Impact & Next Steps</h4>
<p class="text-center">
  We learned much about the design process specifically in regards to transmissions.
