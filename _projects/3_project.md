<!-- ðŸ§­ Project Overview -->
<h4 class="text-center mt-5">Project Overview</h4>
<div class="text-center my-4">
Our task was to determine the effects of walking on sloped vs leveled surfaces on ones joint angles and torques using OpenSim software. We generated data from OpenSim and used it to make conclusions.
