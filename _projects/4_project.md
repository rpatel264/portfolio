<!-- 🧭 Project Overview -->
<h4 class="text-center mt-5">Project Overview</h4>
<div class="text-center my-4">
Design, fabricate, test, analyze and optimize a walking machine with the following requirements:

1. Two legs must be 4-bar linkages and two legs must be operated by cam linkages.

2. A single electric motor powered by batteries using gears, belts, or chains must drive all 4 legs.

3. The Walker size must fit inside a 30 cm3 cube.
​
4. A clear understanding of design optimization and lecture material must be demonstrated.

<!-- 🔧 Final Outcome -->
<h4 class="text-center mt-5">Final Outcome</h4>
<div class="text-center my-4">
  We learned how to implement 4-bar linkages and Cam to create a walker. The walker traveled a distance of 8+ meters followed all requirements.
