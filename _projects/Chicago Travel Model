<!-- 🧭 Project Overview -->
<h4 class="text-center mt-5">Project Overview</h4>
<div class="text-center my-4">
  The Chicago Historical Travel Assistant is a locally-hosted AI system designed to make historical Chicago documents interactive and searchable. The architecture combines PDF processing, natural language processing, and semantic search to deliver factual answers from archival content. 
  
  The workflow works as follows:
</div>
  <ol style="text-align:left; display:inline-block; text-align:left; max-width:700px;">
    <li><strong>PDF Processing:</strong> Raw historical PDFs are loaded and converted to clean text, removing page artifacts and preserving readability.</li>
    <li><strong>Text Chunking:</strong> Documents are split into 400–600 word chunks to keep information manageable for the AI model.</li>
    <li><strong>Summarization:</strong> Each chunk is summarized using a locally hosted LLaMA-based model via Ollama, extracting only factual content and avoiding assumptions.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Summaries and metadata (source PDF, chunk index) are saved in a structured JSON format for efficient retrieval.</li>
    <li><strong>Semantic Retrieval:</strong> Queries are processed using sentence-transformer embeddings to rank summaries by relevance. Keyword search and optional year filters are also supported.</li>
    <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> A Streamlit web app allows users to type questions about Chicago’s history, landmarks, and architecture, displaying ranked results with citations and source references.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
  This project demonstrates end-to-end AI system design, integrating archival research with local LLM processing, semantic search, and an interactive web interface.

<!-- 🔧 Final Outcome -->
<h4 class="text-center mt-5">Final Outcome</h4>
<div class="text-center my-4">
  The final Streamlit app allows users to explore Chicago's rich history in a modern, interactive way. Users receive factual, cited summaries of events, landmarks, and architecture, directly sourced from historical PDFs. The system supports semantic ranking, keyword queries, and optional year-based filtering, making archival research fast and intuitive.
