<!-- 🧭 Project Overview -->
<h4 class="text-center mt-5">Project Overview</h4>
<div class="text-center my-4">
The Chicago Historical Travel Assistant is a locally-hosted AI system designed to make historical Chicago documents interactive, searchable, and easy to explore. The system combines **PDF processing, large language model summarization, semantic search, and a web interface** to deliver factual answers from archival content.

<!-- Architecture and Workflow -->
<h4 class="text-center mt-5">Architecture and Workflow</h4>
<div class="text-center my-4">
The project is built as a modular pipeline with clear separation between data processing, AI summarization, retrieval, and user interface. The workflow can be broken down into six key components:
</div>

<ol style="text-align:left; display:inline-block; max-width:800px;">
  <li><strong>PDF Processing:</strong> Historical PDFs are loaded from a local directory. Text is extracted using <code>pdfplumber</code>, cleaning up artifacts from scanned pages and preserving the original structure of paragraphs and headings.</li>

  <li><strong>Text Chunking:</strong> Extracted text is split into 400–600 word chunks. This ensures that each portion of text is small enough for efficient AI summarization while retaining enough context for accurate information retrieval.</li>

  <li><strong>Summarization with Local LLM:</strong> Each chunk is processed by a locally-hosted LLaMA-based model through Ollama. Summaries are strictly factual, avoiding speculative language, and are limited to concise paragraphs. Retries are built in for failed chunk summarizations.</li>

  <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> Summaries are saved in <code>summary_chunks.json</code> along with metadata such as the source PDF, chunk index, and a short preview. This structured format enables rapid access for search and display.</li>

  <li><strong>Semantic Retrieval:</strong> User queries are encoded using sentence-transformer embeddings and compared with chunk embeddings for relevance ranking. This allows the system to return the most contextually relevant summaries. The system previously supported keyword and year-based filtering but now relies on semantic search for accurate retrieval.</li>

  <li><strong>Web Interface:</strong> A clean Streamlit app allows users to input queries about Chicago's history, architecture, events, and landmarks. Results are displayed in expandable cards with source PDF and chunk citation, along with a relevance score computed from the semantic embeddings.</li>
</ol>

<div class="text-center my-4">
  The modular design ensures that each stage of the workflow—data ingestion, summarization, retrieval, and UI—can be maintained and upgraded independently. For example, upgrading to a larger local LLM or integrating new historical PDFs does not require changing the retrieval or frontend code.
</div>

<!-- 🔧 Final Outcome -->
<h4 class="text-center mt-5">Final Outcome</h4>
<div class="text-center my-4">
The final Streamlit app enables users to explore Chicago's rich history interactively. Users receive **factually accurate, cited summaries** of historical events, landmarks, and architecture directly sourced from archival PDFs. The semantic search ensures that queries like <em>"why is the river reversed"</em> return precise, contextually relevant information.

A live version of the app is available <a href="https://ai-travel-model-rpatel.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">here</a>.
