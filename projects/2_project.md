<h4 class="text-center mt-5">Project Overview</h4>
<div class="text-center my-4">
  We were tasked with designing and fabricating a mechanical transmission capable of lifting suspended weights at two distinct speeds — one forward and one reverse — with the ability to hold the weight in place via an integrated idle/brake mechanism. The system required precise gear coordination to switch seamlessly between speed modes and lock motion when idle.

  The design process included brainstorming multiple gear configurations, selecting appropriate materials, and validating fit through CAD simulations before fabrication.

<!-- 🔧 Final Outcome -->
<h4 class="text-center mt-5">Final Outcome</h4>
<div class="text-center my-4">
  Our approach began with researching various mechanical transmission architectures, including planetary and spur gear systems. After iterating through several concepts, we selected a layout that met all performance and safety requirements, and developed a complete CAD model for analysis and fabrication. Finally creating a working transmission that can lift up to 2kg at a controlled rate using 3D parts.
